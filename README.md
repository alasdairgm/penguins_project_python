Data was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

In this project I assessed the bill lengths between species (Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo) and tested a hypothesis based on these. I went on to produce a correlation matrix between the numeric variables associated with the penguin species.
